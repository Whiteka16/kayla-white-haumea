<h2> About </h2>
<p>My name is Kayla! It means "pure" according
to 'TheBump.com'- a baby name database haha.
 I enjoy being outside, reading, and engaging 
 in invigorating conversation with like-minded
 individuals. I dont debate, I just enjoy being
 in an echo-chamber lol. I love humanity and the environment,
 a big interesection for me as I learn how to code
 and bring together my vision for the future is environmental justice.
 As tech advances, so many people are left behind in an archaic world fighting just to have
 access to running water while I on the other side of money, can send funny philosphy memes to my friends
 at the tapping of a screen. Its an odd existence.
 That's a little about my brain and my spirit.  </p>
