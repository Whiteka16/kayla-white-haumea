<h2> About </h2>
    <p>My name is Kayla! It means "pure" according
    to 'TheBump.com'- a baby name database haha.
     I enjoy being outside, reading, and engaging 
    in invigorating conversation with like-minded
    individuals. I dont debate, I just enjoy being
    in an echo-chamber lol. I love humanity and the environment,
    a big interesection for me as I learn how to code
    and bring together my vision for the future is environmental justice.
    As tech advances, so many people are left behind in an archaic world fighting just to have
    access to running water while I on the other side of money, can send funny philosphy memes to my friends
    at the tapping of a screen. Its an odd existence. All of the work in this portfolio will be a representation of the love for all life that exists in this realm.   </p>
